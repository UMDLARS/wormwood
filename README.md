# wormwood
A nuclear reactor "simulator" exploring four major problems in C programs:

 1. buffer overflow
 1. off-by-one errors
 1. integer overflow / underflow
 1. string format vulnerabilities

## quickstart

 1. Clone this repository onto a Linux machine.
 1. `cd` into the repository
 1. Execute `./run.sh`
 1. Log in as the `oper` user with the password `HomerSimpson`

Without looking at the source code, try to make the reactor fail using each of the four vulnerabilities.
